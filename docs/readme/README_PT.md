# Versioning
I would love to say that [SemVer](https://semver.org/) or anything like that is used but, in my personal experience, this kind of approach doesn't work very well with me, the guy who could be committing in this project for two weeks in a roll and leave it for almost one year with no simple ```npm update```. So, no versioning system is used. 

## Testing
There's a [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/) integration and I've written all the testing with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/).

## Code
Plain and simple [Typescript](http://typescriptlang.org/) and the [Microsoft linter standards](https://github.com/Microsoft/tslint-microsoft-contrib) for it.

# Contributing
Just talk to me through opening a issue.

# TODO
Since I will be keeping this README up to date with any major change and I don't use any versioning system to log all the fixed bugs or previous projects updates, you can still have a taste of what comes next and what is being under analysis right in the [Projects](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/MDNSearchBot/projects/) tab.
